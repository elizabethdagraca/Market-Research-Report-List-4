<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Pneumatic Tires Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Solid Pneumatic Tire</li><li>Pneumatic Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial pneumatic tires are used in various heavy equipment and machinery in industries. The market for these tires can be divided into two main types: solid pneumatic tire and pneumatic tire. Solid pneumatic tires are solid rubber tires that do not require air, making them puncture-proof and maintenance-free. On the other hand, pneumatic tires require air for inflation and offer better shock absorption and traction. Both types have their own advantages and are suited for different applications based on the needs of the industry.</p></p>
