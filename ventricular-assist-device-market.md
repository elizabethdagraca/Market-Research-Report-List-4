<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ventricular Assist Device Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>LVADs</li><li>RVADs</li><li>BIVADs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ventricular Assist Devices, or VADs, are mechanical pumps used to support heart function in patients with severe heart failure. There are three main types of VADs: Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs) which help the left side of the heart pump blood to the body, Right Ventricular Assist Devices (RVADs) which support the right side of the heart, and Biventricular Assist Devices (BIVADs) which assist both sides of the heart. Each type of VAD has specific applications depending on the patient's needs and condition.</p></p>
