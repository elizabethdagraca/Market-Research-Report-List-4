<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Submarine Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Impregnated Paper Insulated Cable</li><li>Oil-filled Cable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Submarine cables are used for communications and power transmission underwater. Impregnated paper insulated cables are traditional cables where paper is impregnated with oil or compound for insulation. Oil-filled cables have oil as the primary insulation material. Both types of cables are used for transmitting electrical signals or power across long distances underwater. Impregnated paper insulated cables are cost-effective but have limitations in terms of voltage and capacity, while oil-filled cables are more expensive but offer higher performance and reliability.</p></p>
