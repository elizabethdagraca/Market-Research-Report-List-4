<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electronic Probe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Touch Probe</li><li>Non-Contact Probe</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Touch probe and non-contact probe are two types of electronic probes used in various industries such as manufacturing, automotive, and aerospace. Touch probes make physical contact with the surface being measured, allowing for precise measurements and inspections. Non-contact probes, on the other hand, use technologies like lasers or cameras to measure without touching the surface, making them ideal for delicate or hard-to-reach areas. Both types of probes play a crucial role in ensuring accurate and efficient quality control in manufacturing processes.</p></p>
