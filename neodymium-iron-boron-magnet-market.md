<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Neodymium Iron Boron Magnet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bonded NdFeB</li><li>Sintered NdFeB</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB) magnets are available in two main types in the market - Bonded NdFeB and Sintered NdFeB. Bonded NdFeB magnets are made by compressing NdFeB powder with a polymer binder, offering lower magnetic properties but higher mechanical strength. On the other hand, Sintered NdFeB magnets are produced through a powder metallurgy process, providing superior magnetic properties but lower mechanical strength. Both types cater to different applications based on the specific performance requirements of the end-use products.</p></p>
