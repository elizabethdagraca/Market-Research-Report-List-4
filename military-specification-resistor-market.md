<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Military Specification Resistor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Through Hole</li><li>Surface Mount</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Military Specification Resistor market consists of two main types: Through Hole and Surface Mount. Through Hole resistors have leads that are inserted into holes on the circuit board and soldered in place, providing a strong mechanical connection. Surface Mount resistors are smaller and mount directly onto the surface of the circuit board, saving space and allowing for higher component density. Both types are commonly used in military applications due to their high reliability, precision, and ability to withstand harsh environmental conditions.</p></p>
