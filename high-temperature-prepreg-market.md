<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High-Temperature Prepreg Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Autoclave Processing</li><li>Out-Of-Autoclave Processing</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High-Temperature Prepreg Market Types include Autoclave Processing and Out-Of-Autoclave Processing. Autoclave Processing involves placing the prepreg material in an autoclave for curing under high pressure and temperature, resulting in excellent consolidation and overall quality. Out-Of-Autoclave Processing, on the other hand, does not require an autoclave and utilizes alternative curing methods such as vacuum bagging or press curing. This method is more cost-effective but may result in slightly lower quality compared to Autoclave Processing.</p></p>
