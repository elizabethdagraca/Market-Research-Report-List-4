<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flangedless Butterfly Valves Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Soft Seal Valve</li><li>Hard Seal Valve</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Flangedless butterfly valves are available in two main types: soft seal valves and hard seal valves. Soft seal valves use a flexible material like rubber to create a tight seal, making them ideal for applications where a leak-proof seal is necessary. Hard seal valves, on the other hand, use metal or another hard material to create a more durable seal, suitable for high-pressure or high-temperature environments. Both types offer efficient flow control and are widely used in various industries.</p></p>
