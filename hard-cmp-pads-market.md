<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Hard CMP Pads Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Abrasive Type</li><li>Normal Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Hard CMP pads are used in the semiconductor manufacturing process to planarize wafers. There are two main types of hard CMP pads: abrasive type and normal type. The abrasive type pads contain abrasive particles that effectively remove material from the wafer surface, resulting in high removal rates. On the other hand, normal type pads are less abrasive and are used for less aggressive polishing processes. Both types of pads play a crucial role in achieving the desired surface smoothness and flatness in semiconductor manufacturing.</p></p>
