<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Boiler Corrosion Inhibitor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Organic Corrosion Inhibitor</li><li>Inorganic Corrosion Inhibitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Organic corrosion inhibitors are primarily composed of carbon-based molecules that form a protective layer on the metal surface, preventing corrosion. They are often used in environments where pH levels are neutral or slightly alkaline. Inorganic corrosion inhibitors, on the other hand, contain metallic compounds that work by forming a protective barrier on the metal surface, inhibiting the corrosion process. Both types of inhibitors play a critical role in maintaining the integrity and longevity of boiler systems by reducing the corrosive effects of water and steam.</p></p>
