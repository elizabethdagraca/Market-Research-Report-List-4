<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CMOS Image Sensor CIS for Non mobile Applications Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rolling Shutter</li><li>Global Shutter</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CMOS Image Sensors (CIS) are crucial in non-mobile applications like surveillance, automotive, and industrial imaging. They primarily utilize two types of readout mechanisms: rolling shutter and global shutter. Rolling shutter captures images line by line, leading to potential distortion with fast-moving subjects. In contrast, global shutter captures the entire frame simultaneously, eliminating motion artifacts, making it ideal for dynamic scenes. The choice between these two types largely depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as speed and image quality.</p></p>
