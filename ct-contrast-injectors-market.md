<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CT Contrast Injectors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Syringeless Power Injectors</li><li>Dual-syringe Power Injectors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>CT contrast injectors are devices used to inject contrast media into a patient's body during a CT scan. There are two main types of CT contrast injectors - syringeless power injectors and dual-syringe power injectors. Syringeless power injectors allow for the contrast media to be delivered directly from a bottle or vial, eliminating the need for manual syringe loading. Dual-syringe power injectors use two syringes to deliver contrast media simultaneously, allowing for quicker injection rates and improved image quality during CT scans.</p></p>
